Installation

  To install TCPDirect from a tarball:

    1. As root, unpack the tar file using the tar command:

         tar -zxvf tcpdirect-<version>.tgz

       This will unpack the tar file and, within the current directory,
       create a sub-directory called tcpdirect-<version> which contains
       other sub-directories including the scripts directory from
       which subsequent install commands can be run.

    2. Go to the scripts directory:

         cd tcpdirect-<version>/scripts

    3. Install TCPDirect in the system directories:

         ./zf_install

  Successful installation is indicated with the following output:

    TCPDirect install complete


  To install TCPDirect from a Source RPM:

    1. Build the binary RPM from the source RPM file:

         rpmbuild --rebuild <source_rpm_path>

       where <source_rpm_path> is the full path to the source RPM.

    2. The build procedure generates a lot of console output. Towards
       the end of the build a "Wrote:" line identifies the location of
       the built binary RPM. For example:

         Wrote: <path>/tcpdirect-<module_version>.rpm

    3. Copy the "Wrote:" location that your server output, and use it
       install the binary RPM. For example:

         rpm -Uvh <path>/tcpdirect-<module_version>.rpm
