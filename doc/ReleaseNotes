       This will unpack the tar file and, within the current directory,
       create a sub-directory called tcpdirect-<version> which contains
       other sub-directories including the scripts directory from
       which subsequent install commands can be run.

    2. Go to the scripts directory:

         cd tcpdirect-<version>/scripts

         rpmbuild --rebuild <source_rpm_path>

    2. The build procedure generates a lot of console output. Towards
       the end of the build a "Wrote:" line identifies the location of
       the built binary RPM. For example:
