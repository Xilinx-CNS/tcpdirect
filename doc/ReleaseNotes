TCPDirect-9.0.0
===============

  This is a feature release of TCPDirect that includes improvements since
  TCPDirect-8.1.3.8. See the ChangeLog for a list of changes.

  TCPDirect must be used with a matching version of Onload, in this case
  Onload version 9.0.0. The network adapter and operating system support
  derives from those supported by Onload.


Public Onload/ef_vi control plane API
-------------------------------------

  The Onload control plane in this Onload-9.0.0 is presented via a new
  public API that can be used by ef_vi applications. As an ef_vi application,
  TCPDirect now uses this API to query the control plane server.


TCPDirect distributed as source code
------------------------------------

  TCPDirect has been relicensed with the MIT open source license and
  since v9.0.0 is shipped as a source package rather than a binary package.

  The packaging for Onload and TCPDirect has been refreshed to allow
  suitable new build and installation workflows for the TCPDirect source
  package.

  There is no longer a 'tarball' distribution type as the RPM and DEB source
  packages are suitable for all supported OSs.


New onload-devel package required
---------------------------------

  Onload now includes a package containing headers required by ef_vi
  applications like TCPDirect. Installing this package is now required to
  install TCPDirect binaries as well as to build TCPDirect applications.

  Headers can also be installed via new '--headers' option in 'onload_install'
  as of Onload-9.0.0.


Installation
------------

  To install TCPDirect from a Source RPM:

    0. The Source RPM depends upon the openonload and openonload-devel packages
       in addition to any other dependencies.

    1. Build the binary RPM from the source RPM file:

         rpmbuild --rebuild <source_rpm_path>

       where <source_rpm_path> is the full path to the source RPM.

    2. The build procedure generates a lot of console output. Towards
       the end of the build a "Wrote:" line identifies the location of
       the built binary RPM. For example:

         Wrote: <path>/tcpdirect-<module_version>.rpm

    3. Copy the "Wrote:" location that your server output, and use it
       install the binary RPM. For example:

         rpm -Uvh <path>/tcpdirect-<module_version>.rpm


  To install TCPDirect from a DEB:

    0. The DEB package depends on *onload-user and *onload-dev packages in
       addition to any other dependencies.

    1. Extract debian-source tarball:

         tar -xf tcpdirect_<version>-debiansource.tgz

    2. Unpack debian source archive

         dpkg-source -x tcpdirect_<version>-1.dsc

    3. Enter newly created tcpdirect directory

         cd tcpdirect-<version>

    4. Build debian package

         debuild -i -uc -us

    5. Install debian package

         dpkg -i tcpdirect_<version>-1_amd64.deb
