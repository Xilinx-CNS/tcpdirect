TCPDirect-9.0.0
===============

  This is a feature release of TCPDirect that includes fixes and other changes
  since the TCPDirect-8.1.3.8.

  See the ChangeLog for a list of fixes.

  TCPDirect must be used with a matching version of Onload, in this case
  Onload version 9.0.0. The network adapter and operating system support
  derives from those supported by Onload.


Public Onload/ef_vi control plane API
-------------------------------------

  The Onload control plane in this Onload-9.0.0 is presented via a new
  public API that can be used by ef_vi applications. As an ef_vi application,
  TCPDirect now uses this API to query the control plane server.


TCPDirect distributed as source code
------------------------------------

  TCPDirect has been relicensed with the MIT open source license and
  since v9.0.0 is shipped as a source package rather than a binary package.

  The packaging for Onload and TCPDirect has been refreshed to allow
  suitable new build and installation workflows for the TCPDirect source
  package.


Installation
------------

  To install TCPDirect from a tarball:

    1. As root, unpack the tar file using the tar command:

         tar -zxvf tcpdirect-<version>.tgz

       This will unpack the tar file and, within the current directory,
       create a sub-directory called tcpdirect-<version> which contains
       other sub-directories including the scripts directory from
       which subsequent install commands can be run.

    2. Go to the scripts directory:

         cd tcpdirect-<version>/scripts

    3. Install TCPDirect in the system directories:

         ./zf_install

  Successful installation is indicated with the following output:

    TCPDirect install complete


  To install TCPDirect from a Source RPM:

    0. The Source RPM depends upon the openonload and openonload-devel packages
       in addition to any other dependencies.

    1. Build the binary RPM from the source RPM file:

         rpmbuild --rebuild <source_rpm_path>

       where <source_rpm_path> is the full path to the source RPM.

    2. The build procedure generates a lot of console output. Towards
       the end of the build a "Wrote:" line identifies the location of
       the built binary RPM. For example:

         Wrote: <path>/tcpdirect-<module_version>.rpm

    3. Copy the "Wrote:" location that your server output, and use it
       install the binary RPM. For example:

         rpm -Uvh <path>/tcpdirect-<module_version>.rpm


  To install TCPDirect from a DEB:

    0. The DEB package depends on an *onload-user package in addition to any
       other dependencies.

    1. Install the DEB package with the following command:

         dpkg -i tcpdirect_<version>-1_amd64.deb
