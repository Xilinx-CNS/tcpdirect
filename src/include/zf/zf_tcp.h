** \param flags    Flags. 0 or MSG_MORE.
**
** This function adds the supplied data (as indicated by the buf
** argument) to the zocket's send queue and if possible will send it
** (or part of it) on the wire.  To prevent a small packet being sent
** the MSG_MORE flag can be used: it will prevent a packet that is not
** filled up to MSS from being sent.
**
** There is no guarantee that separate calls to this function will
** result in separate packets.  To achieve control over packet
** boundaries the delegated sends API can be used instead.  The
** "single" in the name of the function refers to it taking a single
** buffer rather than an iovec of buffers.
**
** Provided buffer may be re-used on return from this function.
**
** \return Number of bytes sent on success.
** \return -EINVAL    Incorrect arguments supplied.
** \return -ENOTCONN  Zocket is not in a valid TCP state for sending.
** \return -EAGAIN    Not enough space (either bytes or buffers) in the send
**                    queue to send any portion of the data.
** \return -ENOMEM    Not enough packet buffers available.
**
** \note This function does not support sending zero-length data,
** and does not raise an error if you do so.
**
** \note The flags argument must be set to 0 or MSG_MORE.
**
** \note This function will send only part of the data provided if there is
** insufficient space in the send queue to send all of it (and there are
** no error conditions). Use zft_send_space() immediately before this call
** to determine in advance whether only part of the data would be sent.
**
** \note Notes on current implementation:
** 1. Currently, this function will return `-ENOMEM` without sending any data
** if it is unable to send the entire message due to shortage of packet buffers.
** This behaviour might change in future releases.
**
** 2. MSG_MORE flag prevents the last partially filled segment from
** being sent immediately.  The only guaranteed way to flush such a segment
** is to follow MSG_MORE send with normal send - otherwise the segment
** might never get sent at all or it may take undefined amount of time.  Some
** non-guaranteed triggers that might induce flush of a MSG_MORE segment:
**  * further MSG_MORE send causes the segment to become full,
**  * preceding normal send left paritally filled segment in sendqueue, or
**  * during stack polling TCP state machine intends to send ACK in
**    response to incoming data.
