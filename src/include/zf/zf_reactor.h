** \param st           Stack for which to process events.
**
** This function processes events on a stack and performs the necessary
** handling.  These events include transmit and receive events raised by the
** hardware, and also software events such as TCP timers.  Applications must
** call zf_reactor_perform(), zf_reactor_perform_attr() or zf_muxer_wait()
** frequently for each stack that is in use.  Please see
** \ref using_stack_poll in the User Guide for further information.
**
** By default this function has relatively high CPU overhead when no events
** are ready to be processed, because it polls repeatedly for events.  The
** amount of time spent polling is controlled by stack attribute
** reactor_spin_count.  Setting reactor_spin_count to 1 disables polling
** and minimises the cost of zf_reactor_perform(). To override
** reactor_spin_count for a single call, zf_reactor_perform_attr() can be
** used instead.
**
** \return 0  if nothing user-visible occurred as a result.
** \return >0 if something user-visible might have occurred as a result.
** \return Here, "something user-visible occurred" means that the
**         event-processing just performed has had an effect that can be seen
**         by another API call: for example, new data might have arrived on a
**         zocket, in which case that data can be retrieved by one of the
**         receive functions.  False positives are possible: a value greater
**         than zero indicates to the application that it should process its
**         zockets, but it does not guarantee that this will yield anything
**         new.  Finer-grained advertisement of interesting events can be
**         achieved using the multiplexer.

** This function differs from zf_reactor_perform() in that the
** reactor_spin_count stack attribute will be overriden using the provided
** attributes. In all other respects it is identical to zf_reactor_perform().

** \param st           Stack to check for pending work.
**
** This function is a cut-down version of zf_stack_has_pending_work().
** It returns non-zero if the stack has events pending, and therefore
** the application should call zf_reactor_perform(),
** zf_reactor_perform_attr() or zf_muxer_wait().
**
** This differs from zf_stack_has_pending_work() in that it never
** tries to check whether there is non-event-based work (such as
** processing TCP timers) pending.  If the calling application knows
** there is no TCP work (e.g. it is using only UDP zockets) this
** function may be a few cycles cheaper.
